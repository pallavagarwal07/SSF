# SSF
This is the portal for automating the Senator Seed Fund form used by the Students' Gymkhana of IIT Kanpur. SSF is used to conduct new activities in the councils, and also by hobby groups to get funds for their activities.
This change is a part of a demo for a lecture on Open Source, taken on behalf of
Programming Club, IIT Kanpur.
